# How to Use SecuriDesign for CorelDRAW X3
 
SecuriDesign is a set of macros for CorelDRAW and Corel DESIGNER that allow you to create various designs used frequently in security printing (on certificates, bank notes, documents, and so on). With SecuriDesign, you can easily create guilloche patterns right in your CorelDRAW document[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to use SecuriDesign for CorelDRAW X3 to create stunning security designs.

## What is SecuriDesign?
 
SecuriDesign is a product of OberonPlace.com, a website dedicated to providing useful tools and information for CorelDRAW and Corel DESIGNER users. SecuriDesign consists of three basic modules: Contour Generator, Pattern Generator, and Function Editor[^1^].
 
- Contour Generator is similar to the Contour effect in CorelDRAW with the exception of CorelDRAW's effect creating contour lines with constant offset from a control object. SecuriDesign uses harmonic functions to modulate the offset and thus easily generates base curves for various design elements such as rosettes[^1^].
- Pattern Generator is used to produce guilloche "fills" between two selected curves in your CorelDRAW document. You need to have two curve shapes which are used as envelopes for the pattern. The resulting fill follows the path of both envelopes. You can use either the contour curves created by the Contour Generator or you can draw any curves using CorelDRAW's drawing tools. Pattern Generator allows you to generate complex designs in one step[^1^].
- Function Editor is used to create mathematical functions used by the above two modules when creating contours and patterns. You specify a function description as a set of Fourier coefficients or you can draw a function in your CorelDRAW document and have the Function Editor to "digitize" the function and produce the coefficients automatically to best fit the representation you drew. Function Editor is available directly from both Contour and Pattern Generator dialogs[^1^].

## How to Install SecuriDesign?
 
To use SecuriDesign for CorelDRAW X3, you need to have a retail version of CorelDRAW X3 installed on your system. You also need to ensure that Visual Basic for Applications is installed along with CorelDRAW X3[^2^]. To install SecuriDesign, you can download the setup file from OberonPlace.com[^1^] or from other trusted sources[^3^]. Run the setup program and it will install all the files for you automatically. After installation, you will see a SecuriDesign toolbar in your CorelDRAW X3 workspace:
 ![SecuriDesign toolbar](securidesign_toolbar.png) 
Or you can launch either macro by going to Tools>Visual Basic>Play... dialog and choose "SecuriDesign (SecuriDesign.gms)" from "Macros in:" list. You will see the two macros in the "Macro Name:" list: ContourGenerator and PatternGenerator. Select the macro you need and click "Run" button[^1^].
 
## How to Use Contour Generator?
 
To use Contour Generator, you need to have a curve object selected in your CorelDRAW document. This curve will be used as a control object for generating contour lines. Then click on the Contour Generator button on the SecuriDesign toolbar or run the macro from the Tools menu. You will see a dialog box like this:
 ![Contour Generator dialog](contour_generator_dialog.png) 
In this dialog, you can specify various parameters for creating contour lines such as number of contours, distance between contours, function type, function coefficients, etc. You can also preview the result in the Preview window before applying it to your document. Click OK when you are satisfied with your settings and the contour lines will be created as separate curve objects on top of your control object[^1^].
