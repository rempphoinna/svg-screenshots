## Step 3: Configure Gsdx 0.1.16 Plugin
 
The final step is to configure the Gsdx 0.1.16 plugin according to your preferences and system specifications. To do this, you need to go to Config > Video (GS) > Plugin Settings. Here you will see various options that affect the graphics quality and performance of your games.
 
The most important option is the Renderer, which lets you choose between DirectX and OpenGL APIs, as well as hardware and software rendering modes. Hardware rendering uses your graphics card to render the picture, which is faster and preferred for most games. Software rendering uses your CPU to render the picture, which is slower but more accurate for some games that have graphical glitches or artifacts in hardware mode.
 
The best renderer for you depends on your graphics card model and driver version, as well as the game you are playing. Generally speaking, DirectX 11 is recommended for Nvidia cards, while OpenGL is recommended for AMD cards. However, some games may work better with a different renderer, so you may need to experiment with different settings until you find the best one.
 
Another important option is the Internal Resolution, which lets you increase or decrease the resolution of the game beyond its native PS2 resolution (640x448). Increasing the resolution will make the game look sharper and clearer, but it will also require more processing power from your graphics card and may cause slowdowns or crashes in some games. Decreasing the resolution will make the game look blurrier and pixelated, but it will also improve the performance and compatibility of some games.
 
The best internal resolution for you depends on your monitor size and resolution, as well as your graphics card capabilities and preferences. Generally speaking, you should aim for a multiple of the native PS2 resolution (such as 1280x896 or 1920x1344) for optimal results.
 
Other options that affect the graphics quality and performance are Anti-aliasing, Texture Filtering, Anisotropic Filtering, Mipmapping, CRC Hack Level, Blending Unit Accuracy, etc. You can read more about these options and their
