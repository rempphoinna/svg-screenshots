Now that you have Adobe Lightroom CC 2019 installed on your PC, you may want to learn some tips and tricks to make the most of this powerful software. Here are some of our favorites:
 
- Dragging the Histogram: You can adjust the exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, and blacks of your photo by dragging the histogram in the Basic panel. This is a quick and easy way to fine-tune your image without using the sliders.
- Shift-Click Sliders: You can reset any slider to its default value by shift-clicking on it. This is useful if you want to undo a change or start over with a different adjustment.
- Mouse-dragging slider values: You can change the value of any slider by clicking on its name and dragging your mouse left or right. This gives you more precise control over the adjustments than using the slider itself.
- Bigger develop panel: You can make the develop panel bigger by pressing F5 to hide the top panel and F6 to hide the bottom panel. This gives you more space to work on your photo and see the changes more clearly.
- Double-click sliders: You can double-click on any slider to activate it and then use the up and down arrow keys to change its value. This is another way to make fine adjustments without using the mouse.
- Camera profiles: You can change the look of your photo by applying different camera profiles in the Profile Browser. These are presets that emulate how different cameras process colors and tones. You can find them under the Basic panel or by clicking on Browse in the Profile section.
- Camera profile opacity: You can adjust the strength of any camera profile by using the Amount slider in the Profile section. This lets you blend the profile with your original photo and create a custom look.
- Spot removal visualization: You can visualize where you need to remove spots or blemishes from your photo by pressing A on your keyboard. This will show you a black and white overlay that highlights any imperfections. You can then use the Spot Removal tool to fix them.
- Straighten image: You can straighten your image by using the Crop tool and clicking on the Angle icon. Then you can drag along a line that should be horizontal or vertical in your photo and Lightroom will automatically rotate and crop your image accordingly.
- Different crop grids: You can change the crop grid overlay by pressing O on your keyboard. This will cycle through different options such as Rule of Thirds, Golden Ratio, Golden Spiral, etc. These can help you compose your image better and follow some basic photography rules.
