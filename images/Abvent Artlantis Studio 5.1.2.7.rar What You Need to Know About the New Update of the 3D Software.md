- Viewpoints: You can create, save and organize multiple viewpoints of your scene, each with different parameters such as date, light source, camera lens, background, etc.
- Inspectors: You can access all the settings related to shaders, objects, lights, heliodons and perspectives from the top of the screen, with a minimum of clicks.
- 2D view: You can work in a 2D view window to perform tasks that are difficult to do in perspective, such as drawing a curved path of a camera, setting the height of an object, stitching different iVisit 3D panoramas together, etc.
- Postcards: You can save and retrieve any material settings as postcards, which are images that contain all the material parameters as well. Postcards are useful for creating your own collection of custom shaders and comparing different options on your projects.

Abvent Artlantis Studio 5.1.2.7 is a powerful 3D rendering software that can help you create stunning images and animations of your architectural and design projects.
  
One of the main features of Abvent Artlantis Studio 5.1.2.7 is its ability to create realistic and dynamic animations of your 3D scenes. You can use Artlantis to stage and design a film from one or more sequences, whose editing is done in a simple and intuitive way thanks to its integrated timeline[^1^]. You can define the tracking of the camera and/or the trajectory of objects and lights of the project; accelerate or decelerate their movement; combine different effects such as depth of field, motion blur, lens flare, etc.; and export your animation in various formats such as AVI, QuickTime, Flash or GIF.
 
Another feature of Abvent Artlantis Studio 5.1.2.7 is its ability to create interactive and immersive 3D presentations of your projects. You can use Artlantis to create iVisit 3D panoramas, which are 360Â° views of your scene that can be explored with a mouse or a touch screen. You can also create iVisit 3D VR objects, which are 3D models that can be manipulated and viewed from all angles. You can share your iVisit 3D presentations online or offline, on a website or on a mobile device.
 
A third feature of Abvent Artlantis Studio 5.1.2.7 is its ability to create realistic and natural lighting effects for your scenes. You can use Artlantis to simulate the sun, the sky, the clouds and the atmosphere with its heliodon tool, which allows you to adjust the geographic location, the date and the time of your scene. You can also use Artlantis to simulate artificial lighting with its light sources tool, which allows you to choose from various types of lights such as spotlights, neon tubes, LEDs, etc. You can also use Artlantis to simulate global illumination with its radiosity engine, which calculates the light bouncing off surfaces and creates soft shadows and color variations.
 
Abvent Artlantis Studio 5.1.2.7 is a powerful 3D rendering software that offers many features to create realistic and dynamic images and animations of your architectural and design projects.
