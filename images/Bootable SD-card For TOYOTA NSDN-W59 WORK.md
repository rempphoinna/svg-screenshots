# How to Create a Bootable SD-Card for TOYOTA NSDN-W59
  
If you have a Toyota car with an embedded navigation system model NSDN-W59, you may have encountered a problem where the system asks you to insert a correct SD card or check the map SD card. This can happen if you lose or damage the original SD card that came with your car, or if you want to update the map data on your system.
  
In this article, we will show you how to create a bootable SD card for your Toyota NSDN-W59 navigation system using a simple and free method. You will need a blank SD card, a computer with an SD card reader, and an internet connection.

## Step 1: Download the Bootable SD Card Recorder Software
  
The first step is to download the bootable SD card recorder software for the Japanese Toyota NSDN-W59 from this link[^1^]. This software is a Docker image that contains all the necessary files and instructions to create a bootable SD card for your navigation system. You will need to install Docker on your computer before you can use this software.
  
To install Docker, follow the instructions on this page: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
  
## Step 2: Run the Bootable SD Card Recorder Software
  
After installing Docker, open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and run the following command:
  `docker run -it --rm -v /dev/sdX:/dev/sdX rerapetlo/bootable-sdcard-for-toyota-nsdnw59-60`  
Replace /dev/sdX with the device name of your SD card reader. You can find out the device name by using the command `lsblk` on Linux or `diskpart` on Windows.
  
This command will download the Docker image from the link above and run it interactively. It will ask you to confirm that you want to overwrite your SD card with the bootable data. Type `y` and press enter to proceed.

## Troubleshooting
  
If you encounter any problems or errors while creating or using your bootable SD card, here are some possible solutions:
  
- Make sure you are using a blank SD card with enough capacity (at least 8 GB) and compatible format (FAT32).
- Make sure you are using the correct device name for your SD card reader when running the Docker command.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection when downloading the Docker image and writing the bootable data to your SD card.
- Make sure you do not interrupt or disconnect your SD card while it is being written.
- Make sure you insert your bootable SD card into your navigation system before turning on your car.
- If you still see a message asking you to insert a correct SD card or check the map SD card, try restarting your car or resetting your navigation system by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds.
- If you want to update the map data on your bootable SD card, you can download the latest map disc CD/DVD/software from this link[^3^] and follow the instructions on how to burn it and insert it into your navigation system.
