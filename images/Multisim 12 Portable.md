Multisim is a powerful software tool for designing and simulating electronic circuits. It is widely used by engineers, researchers, educators and students in various fields of electronics. Multisim offers an intuitive interface, a large library of components, advanced analysis features and seamless integration with hardware platforms such as NI myDAQ, NI myRIO and NI ELVIS.
 
However, installing Multisim on your computer may not always be possible or convenient. For example, you may not have enough disk space, you may not have administrator privileges, or you may need to use Multisim on different computers. In such cases, you can use Multisim 12 Portable, which is a version of Multisim that runs from a USB flash drive or an external hard drive without requiring installation.
