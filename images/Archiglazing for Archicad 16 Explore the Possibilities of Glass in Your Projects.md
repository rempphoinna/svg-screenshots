## How to Use Archiglazing?
 
To use Archiglazing for Archicad 16, you need to install it on your computer after purchasing it from an Archicad reseller. The system and hardware requirements correspond to those of Archicad 16[^1^]. After installing it, you can access it from the Design menu in Archicad 16. You will see six tools that correspond to the different types of glass structures you can create:

1. Vertical Glass Structure Tool: This tool lets you create vertical glass structures along lines, line combinations, or closed contours. You can specify the number and size of the glass panels, the frame type and material, the opening direction and angle, and other parameters.
2. Slanted Glass Structure Tool: This tool lets you create slanted glass structures along lines, line combinations, closed contours, or roof panes. You can adjust the slope angle, the height difference between the top and bottom edges, the frame type and material, and other parameters.
3. Sketch Window Tool: This tool lets you create windows, doors, or freestanding glass structures from draft sketches. You can draw any shape with straight or curved segments and then convert it into a sketch window. You can also position corner glass structures automatically by selecting two adjacent walls.
4. Conic Glass Structure Tool: This tool lets you create conical glass structures along arcs, circles, on circular ceiling apertures or walls. You can define the radius, height, angle, number of segments, frame type and material, and other parameters.
5. Shed Glass Structure Tool: This tool lets you create shed glass structures on rectangular line contours, walls or ceiling apertures. You can set the width, depth, height difference between the front and back edges, frame type and material, and other parameters.
6. Winter Garden Tool: This tool lets you create conservatories using lines and line wall combinations. You can choose from different roof types (flat, gable, hip), wall types (straight or curved), frame type and material,
and other parameters.

For more details on how to use each tool and its options, you can refer to the user guide[^2^] provided by Graphisoft.
