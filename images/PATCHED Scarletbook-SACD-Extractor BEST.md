# How to Extract SACD ISO Files with PATCHED Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor
 
SACD (Super Audio CD) is a high-resolution audio format that uses a special optical disc called ScarletBook. SACD discs can store up to six channels of DSD (Direct Stream Digital) audio, which is a lossless format that preserves the original sound quality of the recording.
 
However, SACD discs are not compatible with most CD players or computers, and they have a copy protection mechanism that prevents ripping or copying the audio files. Therefore, if you want to enjoy SACD music on your devices, you need to extract the SACD ISO files from the disc and convert them to a more common format such as PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) or DSD.

## Step 1: Prepare your PS3 console
 
The first thing you need to do is to prepare your PS3 console for SACD ripping. You need a PS3 console that has a firmware version lower than 3.55, which allows patching and installing custom applications. You also need to install a custom firmware (CFW) on your PS3 console, such as Rebug or Ferrox. You can find more information on how to do this on various online forums and websites.
 
Once you have installed a CFW on your PS3 console, you need to enable the LV1 patch, which allows access to the raw SACD data. You can do this by using a tool such as Rebug Toolbox or Multiman. You also need to install SACD-Ripper on your PS3 console, which is an application that can rip SACD discs to your PS3 hard drive or an external USB drive. You can download SACD-Ripper from [https://sacd-ripper.googlecode.com](https://sacd-ripper.googlecode.com).
 
## Step 2: Rip your SACD disc
 
The next step is to rip your SACD disc using SACD-Ripper on your PS3 console. You need to insert your SACD disc into your PS3 console and launch SACD-Ripper from the XMB (XrossMediaBar) menu. You will see a screen with some options for ripping your SACD disc. You can choose to rip the entire disc as an ISO file, or select individual tracks or albums to rip as DSDIFF or DSF files. You can also choose the destination for saving the ripped files, either on your PS3 hard drive or an external USB drive.
 
After you have selected your options, press Start to begin ripping your SACD disc. The process may take some time depending on the size of your disc and the speed of your PS3 console. When the ripping is done, you will see a message saying "Done!". You can then exit SACD-Ripper and eject your SACD disc from your PS3 console.
 
## Step 3: Extract your SACD ISO file
