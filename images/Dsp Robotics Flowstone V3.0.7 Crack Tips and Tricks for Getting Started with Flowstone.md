3. On the left side of the screen, you will see the Toolbox, where you can find all the components you can use in your project. You can drag and drop them onto the workspace, and connect them with wires to create logic and data flow.
4. On the right side of the screen, you will see the Properties panel, where you can adjust the settings and parameters of each component. You can also double-click on a component to edit its code or script.
5. On the bottom of the screen, you will see the Output panel, where you can see the results of your project. You can also use the buttons to run, stop, or debug your project.
6. To create a user interface for your project, you can use the Panel component, which allows you to add buttons, sliders, labels, and other graphical elements. You can also use the Ruby component to create custom graphics and animations.
7. To create audio processing for your project, you can use the Audio In and Audio Out components, which allow you to capture and play audio from your sound card. You can also use the DSP components, which allow you to apply effects and filters to your audio signal.
8. To create MIDI control for your project, you can use the MIDI In and MIDI Out components, which allow you to send and receive MIDI messages from your MIDI devices. You can also use the MIDI components, which allow you to manipulate MIDI data and generate MIDI notes.
9. To export your project as a standalone executable or a VST plugin, you can use the Export option from the File menu. You can choose between different formats and options depending on your needs.
