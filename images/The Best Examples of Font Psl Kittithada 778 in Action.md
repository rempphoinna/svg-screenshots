The final step is to embed Font PSL Kittithada 778 on your website. There are two main ways to do this: using CSS @font-face or using a web font service. We will explain both methods below.
 
### Method 1: Using CSS @font-face
 
CSS @font-face is a rule that allows you to specify custom fonts for your web pages. To use this method, you need to upload the font files to your web server and link them in your CSS file. For example, you can use the following code:
 `
@font-face 
    font-family: 'PSL Kittithada 778';
    src: url('PSL-Kittithada-778.ttf') format('truetype');

body 
    font-family: 'PSL Kittithada 778', sans-serif;

` 
This code tells the browser to look for the font file named PSL-Kittithada-778.ttf in the same folder as the CSS file and use it as the font family named PSL Kittithada 778. Then, it applies this font family to the body element of the web page. You can also specify different font files for different font weights or styles, such as bold or italic.
 
### Method 2: Using a Web Font Service
 
A web font service is a third-party platform that hosts and delivers custom fonts for your web pages. To use this method, you need to sign up for a web font service account and choose Font PSL Kittithada 778 from their library. Then, you need to copy and paste the code they provide into your HTML or CSS file. For example, you can use Google Fonts as a web font service and use the following code:
 `

body 
    font-family: 'PSL Kittithada 778', sans-serif;

` 
This code tells the browser to load Font PSL Kittithada 778 from Google Fonts and use it as the font family named PSL Kittithada 778. Then, it applies this font family to the body element of the web page. You can also customize the font parameters, such as weight or style, using the Google Fonts interface.
