## Why do I need a serial code to play Batman: Arkham City?
 
Batman: Arkham City was originally released with a digital rights management (DRM) system called Games for Windows Live (GFWL). This system required players to create an online account and enter a serial code that came with the game disc or digital download. The serial code was used to verify the authenticity of the game and prevent piracy. However, GFWL was discontinued in 2014 and many games that used it became unplayable or had limited functionality. This affected Batman: Arkham City as well, as players could not activate the game or access some features such as online multiplayer or downloadable content (DLC).
 
## How can I fix this issue and play Batman: Arkham City?
 
Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem. In 2013, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that they would be moving Batman: Arkham City to Steamworks, a different DRM system that uses the Steam platform. They also gave everyone who owned the original version of the game a free copy of the Game of the Year edition (GOTY) on Steam. The GOTY edition includes all the DLCs and does not require GFWL to play. To access this edition, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Steam client and log in to your account.
2. Go to your library and look for Batman: Arkham City GOTY. If you don't see it, contact Steam support and they should fix it for you.
3. Download and install the game.
4. Launch the game and enter your serial code when prompted.
5. Enjoy playing Batman: Arkham City without any issues.

## Conclusion
 
Batman: Arkham City is a great game that deserves to be played by any fan of the Dark Knight. However, if you have trouble activating it with a serial code, don't worry. You can easily fix this problem by switching to the GOTY edition on Steamworks. This way, you can enjoy the game without any hassle and explore the vast and immersive world of Gotham City.
