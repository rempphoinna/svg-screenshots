# How to Remove IMMO Code of ECU with Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l
 
Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l is a software tool that can help you to remove the IMMO code of ECU (Engine Control Unit) of various car models. IMMO code is a security feature that prevents the car from starting without the correct key or immobilizer device. If you need to repair or replace your ECU, you may need to disable or reset the IMMO code to make it work with your car.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l to remove the IMMO code of ECU with a few simple steps. You will need a programmer device that can read and write the ECU flash memory, such as UPA-USB, WELLON Series VP/GP, Galep, Serial and many others (not supplied with the software). You will also need to download and install Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l on your computer.

## Step 1: Read the ECU flash memory
 
The first step is to read the ECU flash memory with your programmer device and save it as a BIN file on your computer. The BIN file contains the data of the ECU, including the IMMO code. You need to select the correct ECU model and chip type on your programmer device before reading the flash memory. You can find the ECU model and chip type on the label of the ECU or in the software manual.
 
## Step 2: Open the BIN file with Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l
 
The second step is to open the BIN file with Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l software. The software will automatically detect the ECU model and chip type and show you the IMMO code information. You can also manually select the ECU model and chip type from the software menu if the auto-detection fails.
 
## Step 3: Remove or reset the IMMO code
 
The third step is to remove or reset the IMMO code with Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l software. You have two options: you can either make the ECU virgin, which means deleting the IMMO code permanently and allowing you to recode it with a new key or immobilizer device; or you can repair the IMMO code, which means modifying it to match your original key or immobilizer device.
 
To make the ECU virgin, you need to click on the "Make Virgin" button on the software interface and confirm your choice. The software will erase the IMMO code from the BIN file and generate a new LIC.KEY file that contains your license key for using the software.

To repair the IMMO code, you need to click on the "Repair" button on the software interface and enter your original key or immobilizer device code in the input box. The software will modify the IMMO code in the BIN file to match your original code and generate a new LIC.KEY file that contains your license key for using the software.
 
## Step 4: Write the modified BIN file back to the ECU
 
The final step is to write the modified BIN file back to the ECU flash memory with your programmer device. You need to copy both the modified BIN file and the LIC.KEY file to your programmer device and select the correct ECU model and chip type before writing. The writing process may take a few minutes depending on your programmer device speed.
 
After writing, you can reconnect your ECU to your car and test if it works properly. If everything goes well, you have successfully removed or resetted the IMMO code of your ECU with Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l software.
 
## Conclusion
 
Immo Universal Decoding 3.2 Keygen 39l is a powerful software tool that can help you to remove or reset the IMMO code of ECU of various car models. It is compatible with many programmer devices that can read and write
