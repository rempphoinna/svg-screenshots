X-wing Alliance is a classic Star Wars flight simulator game that was released in 1999 by LucasArts. It allows you to fly various starfighters and engage in epic space battles against the Empire. However, if you want to play it on modern systems, you may encounter some issues, such as unreadable fonts, low resolution graphics, and most importantly, the requirement of a joystick to start the game.
 
Fortunately, there are some solutions that can help you enjoy this game with a joystick on your PC. In this article, we will show you how to install the official patch, fix the fonts, and use a utility that can emulate a joystick if you don't have one.

## Step 1: Install the Official Patch
 
The first thing you need to do is to install the official patch 2.02 for X-wing Alliance. This patch fixes some bugs and improves compatibility with newer systems. You can download it from [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-x-wing-alliance-upgrade-project/downloads/x-wing-alliance-v202-patch) [^3^] or [here](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing_Alliance) [^1^]. Just run the executable file and follow the instructions.
 
## Step 2: Fix the Fonts
 
The next step is to fix the fonts in the game. On modern systems, the fonts may appear garbled and unreadable, making it hard to follow the mission objectives and dialogues. To fix this, you need to download a file called FONTS.DAT from [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-x-wing-alliance-upgrade-project/tutorials/x-wing-alliance-202-patch-and-font-fix) [^2^] and place it in the RESDATA folder of your game installation (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Lucasarts\X-Wing Alliance). Overwrite the existing file when prompted.
 
## Step 3: Use a Joystick Emulator
 
The final step is to use a joystick emulator if you don't have a physical joystick. X-wing Alliance requires a joystick to start the game, and it won't work with keyboard or mouse controls. However, there is a utility called XWA Hacker that can emulate a joystick for you. You can download it from [here](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing_Alliance) [^1^]. After downloading it, unzip it and run XWAHacker.exe. Select "Joystick Emulation" from the menu and click "Apply". Then, run xwingalliance.exe with skipintro command line argument to skip the intro videos and start the game.
 
Now you should be able to play X-wing Alliance with a joystick on your PC. Enjoy!
