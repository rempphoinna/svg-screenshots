# How to Install and Activate ElectricVLab with a Serial Number
 
ElectricVLab is a software that lets you design and simulate electric circuits in 3D. It is a useful tool for students, hobbyists, and professionals who want to learn and experiment with electronics. In this article, we will show you how to install and activate ElectricVLab with a serial number.
 
## Step 1: Download the ElectricVLab Installer File
 
When you buy ElectricVLab, you will be provided with a download link and a license key. Please save the license key information somewhere for future reference. By clicking the download link, you can download the ElectricVLab installer file. The installer file has the name ElectricVLabInstaller.msi. In some browsers, the file would get downloaded into your âDownloadsâ folder while some other browsers will prompt you to specify the folder into which you want to download. The exact location on your machine where this installer file gets downloaded into does not matter[^1^].

## Step 2: Install ElectricVLab on Your Machine
 
Once the downloading of the installer file completes, double click the downloaded âElectricVLabInstaller.msiâ file. This starts the installation process. The sequence of dialogs that come up will guide you through the installation process[^1^].
 
## Step 3: Activate ElectricVLab with Your License Key
 
After the installation completes, run ElectricVLab by double clicking the corresponding icon created on your desktop OR via the âStartâ menu. When you run ElectricVLab for the first time on your machine, it will prompt you to enter the license key for the purpose of activating the software. This step involves contacting our server and hence the machine needs to have internet connection when you run ElectricVLab for the first time. If the activation succeeds, you will see the ElectricVLab main window with a blank circuit board. Once activated, for subsequent runs of ElectricVLab, the machine does not need to have internet connection[^1^].

## Step 4: Enjoy ElectricVLab
 
A quick way to jump straight into ElectricVLab would be to load some of the sample pre-built circuits that come with ElectricVLab. This can be done using the Load Sample Circuit option under the File menu. When you want to start building your own circuits, the process is likely to be intuitive. But, it might be a good idea to read at least some parts of the ElectricVLab user manual to become a more efficient user and get an overview of the features present. The user manual can be found under the Help menu in ElectricVLab. The user manual first provides a quick tutorial, and then discusses the many features and their usage[^1^].
